OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:

Project Title:

File Handling Operations in C – Creation, Reading, Writing, and Appending to Text Files

Project Overview:

This project presents a simple yet comprehensive implementation of file handling concepts in the C programming language. File handling is a core component of system-level programming and is crucial for data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. The main objective of this project is to demonstrate how to perform four essential operations on files—creating, writing, reading, and appending—through a structured C program.

In this program, we use a .txt file named text.txt to show how data can be stored permanently and modified over time. The project follows a step-by-step approach to first create a file and write initial content, then read and display this content, append new data to the file, and finally re-read the file to show the updated contents. It serves as a practical demonstration of the use of file input/output (I/O) operations in C, employing functions such as fopen(), fprintf(), fgetc(), and fclose().

Key Functionalities:

File Creation and Writing:
The program starts by creating a new file named text.txt using the "w" (write) mode. If the file already exists, this mode overwrites the existing content. If the file doesn’t exist, it will be created. The fprintf() function is used to write two lines of text to the file. This segment teaches how to handle file creation and how to write formatted output to a file in C
